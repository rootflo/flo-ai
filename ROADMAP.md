## 📊 Beta Release Scope

Current release has the following features implemented:

| Feature | Limitation | 
|---------|------------|
| **Datasource** | You can connect to multiple data sources. Current support is for Google Bigquery and AWS redshift. |
| **Agent** | You can create agents using the console and run them using the middleware. |
| **Workflow** | You can create workflows using the console and run them using the middleware. |
| **Voice Bots** | You can process voice calls using the middleware. But currently only outgoing calls are supported. Only supported telephony service is Twilio |
| **Inference App** | You can create inference pytorch models using the middleware, but the support is limited to certain pytorch models. This feature is fully `experimental`, and APIs are bound to change. |
| **API Service** | You can create API services to connect to any backend service. We have provided support for JSON and non JSON payload. Authenticate is limited to API Key, Basic Auth & Bearer Token. |
