    "# Gen AI Population Simulation Testing for AI Workflow Automation Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "The goal is to generate a population of banking users and use them to simulate banking operations, to test AI workflow automations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea here is to perform a population testing on banking systems using AI, especially AI automated workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy here is to generate customer profiles using Gen AI and use Gen AI is create backstories for these customers. Once we have customers with backstory we simulate an event in customer life which requires interaction with their banks or wealth advisor. This interaction we be handled by an automated AI agent and we see how good the system is able to handle this scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "1. Define the customer schema and the properties the customer should have.\n",
    "2. We create a agentic flo which will generate such customers randomly, the agent saves this data to  SQLite database\n",
    "3. The flo also has an agent which can query the created database which will help the agentic flo to check back the distribution of generated customers\n",
    "4. Once we have the generated customers, we loop through each customer and use their backstore to create a life event, requiring banking help. This will be a new agentic flo which can trigger different banking apis like customer support or sending email etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this excersice we create AI generated customer population and through this we test our automations"
