    explanation = """
❌ THE PROBLEM:
In the original demo, the planner kept getting called in an infinite loop because:

1. Router asks: "Is there a plan in memory?"
2. Memory says: "No ExecutionPlan objects found"
3. Router decides: "Route to planner to create plan"
4. Planner generates plan TEXT but doesn't store ExecutionPlan OBJECTS
5. Router asks again: "Is there a plan in memory?"
6. Memory still says: "No ExecutionPlan objects found"
7. INFINITE LOOP! 🔄

✅ THE SOLUTION:
We need to bridge the gap between plan TEXT and plan OBJECTS:

APPROACH 1: Specialized PlannerAgent
• Custom agent that parses plan text and stores ExecutionPlan objects
• Router can detect when ExecutionPlan exists in memory
• Automatically switches from planning to execution phase

APPROACH 2: Content-Based Routing  
• Router analyzes message content instead of relying on ExecutionPlan objects
• If message contains "PLAN:", switch to execution mode
• Simpler but less sophisticated

APPROACH 3: State Management
• Explicitly track workflow state (planning/executing/reviewing)
• Router uses state instead of trying to detect plan completion
• Most reliable but requires more setup

    print('=' * 35)

    intelligence_demo = """
The PlanExecuteRouter is designed to coordinate complex workflows by:

🎯 PHASE DETECTION:
• Planning Phase: No plan exists → route to planner
• Execution Phase: Plan exists with pending steps → route to executor  
• Review Phase: All steps complete → route to reviewer
• Error Recovery: Failed steps exist → route for retry

📊 STEP MANAGEMENT:
• Analyzes step dependencies automatically
• Only executes steps when dependencies are met
• Tracks progress with visual indicators (○ ⏳ ✅ ❌)
• Handles parallel execution of independent steps

🔄 INTELLIGENT ROUTING:
• Context-aware prompts with plan progress
• Suggests next agent based on plan state
• Prevents infinite loops with completion detection
• Adapts to different workflow patterns

💡 EXAMPLE ROUTING DECISIONS:

Scenario 1: No plan exists
→ Router: "Route to planner to create execution plan"

Scenario 2: Plan exists, step_1 ready
→ Router: "Route to developer to execute step_1"

Scenario 3: Development complete, testing needed
→ Router: "Route to tester to validate implementation"

Scenario 4: All steps complete
→ Router: "Route to reviewer for final approval"

Scenario 5: Step failed
→ Router: "Route to developer to retry failed step"

    print('\n\n🏗️ Working Implementation Components')
    print('=' * 40)

    implementation = """
For a working PlanExecuteRouter implementation, you need:

1. 📋 PLAN STORAGE:
   ```python
   memory = PlanAwareMemory()  # Stores ExecutionPlan objects
   plan = ExecutionPlan(title="...", steps=[...])
   memory.add_plan(plan)
   ```

2. 🤖 SPECIALIZED AGENTS:
   ```python
   class PlannerAgent(Agent):
       def run(self, input_data):
           plan_text = await super().run(input_data)
           execution_plan = self.parse_plan(plan_text)
           self.memory.add_plan(execution_plan)  # KEY!
           return plan_text
   ```

3. 🎯 SMART ROUTING:
   ```python
   router = create_plan_execute_router(
       planner_agent='planner',
       executor_agent='developer',
       reviewer_agent='reviewer'
   )
   ```

4. 🔄 WORKFLOW COORDINATION:
   ```python
   arium = AriumBuilder()
       .with_memory(memory)  # PlanAwareMemory
       .add_agents([planner, developer, tester, reviewer])
       .add_edge(planner, [...], router)
       .build()
   ```

🎯 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS:
• PlannerAgent MUST store ExecutionPlan objects
• Use PlanAwareMemory for plan state persistence  
• Router needs to detect plan existence reliably
• Agents should update step status during execution
