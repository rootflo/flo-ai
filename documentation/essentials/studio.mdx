## What is Flo AI Studio?

Flo AI Studio is a modern, intuitive visual editor that allows you to design complex multi-agent workflows through a drag-and-drop interface. Build sophisticated AI systems without writing code, then export them as production-ready YAML configurations.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
cd studio
pnpm install
```

### Starting the Studio

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The studio will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Studio Features

### Visual Design Interface

- **ðŸŽ¯ Drag-and-Drop**: Create workflows by dragging agents, routers, and tools onto the canvas
- **ðŸ”— Visual Connections**: Connect components with visual edges
- **ðŸ“‹ Property Panels**: Configure components through intuitive property panels
- **ðŸŽ¨ Real-time Preview**: See your workflow structure as you build it

### Agent Management

Configure AI agents with different roles, models, and tools:

- **Agent Roles**: Define what each agent does in your workflow
- **Model Selection**: Choose from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more
- **Tool Integration**: Connect agents to external tools and APIs
- **Prompt Engineering**: Design effective prompts with the built-in editor

### Smart Routing

Configure intelligent routing for your workflows:

- **Conditional Routing**: Route based on content type, sentiment, or custom logic
- **LLM-Powered Routing**: Use AI to make routing decisions
- **Reflection Patterns**: Implement Aâ†’Bâ†’A feedback loops
- **Plan-Execute Workflows**: Create Cursor-style development workflows

## Workflow Design

### Creating a New Workflow

1. **Start with a Template**: Choose from pre-built workflow templates
2. **Add Agents**: Drag agents onto the canvas and configure their properties
3. **Connect Components**: Create connections between agents and routers
4. **Configure Routing**: Set up intelligent routing logic
5. **Test and Validate**: Use the built-in testing tools

### Workflow Templates

The studio comes with several pre-built templates:

- **Content Analysis Pipeline**: Analyze and summarize content
- **Customer Support Workflow**: Route and handle customer inquiries
- **Code Review Process**: Automated code review and feedback
- **Research Assistant**: Multi-step research and analysis

### Custom Workflows

Create your own workflows from scratch:

1. **Define the Goal**: What should your workflow accomplish?
2. **Identify Agents**: What specialized agents do you need?
3. **Design Routing**: How should requests be routed between agents?
4. **Add Tools**: What external tools should agents have access to?
5. **Test and Iterate**: Refine your workflow based on testing

## YAML Export/Import

### Exporting Workflows

Once you've designed your workflow in the studio:

1. Click the "Export" button
2. Choose YAML format
3. Download the configuration file
4. Use in your Flo AI application

```python
from flo_ai.arium import AriumBuilder

# Load and run exported workflow
result = await (
    AriumBuilder()
    .from_yaml(yaml_file='exported_workflow.yaml')
    .build_and_run(["Your input here"])
)
```

### Importing Workflows

Import existing YAML workflows for editing:

1. Click the "Import" button
2. Select your YAML file
3. The workflow will be loaded into the studio
4. Make modifications and re-export

## Advanced Features

### Workflow Validation

The studio includes real-time validation:

- **Connection Validation**: Ensures all components are properly connected
- **Configuration Validation**: Checks that all required fields are filled
- **Logic Validation**: Validates routing logic and conditions
- **Error Highlighting**: Shows errors and warnings in real-time

### Testing Tools

Test your workflows before deployment:

- **Input Testing**: Test with sample inputs
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: See how your workflow processes data
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor execution time and resource usage
- **Debug Mode**: Step through workflow execution

### Collaboration Features

- **Version Control**: Track changes to your workflows
- **Sharing**: Share workflows with team members
- **Comments**: Add comments and notes to workflow components
- **Templates**: Save and share workflow templates

## Best Practices

### Workflow Design

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic linear workflows
2. **Add Complexity Gradually**: Introduce routing and parallel processing
3. **Test Frequently**: Validate your workflow at each step
4. **Document Changes**: Keep track of modifications and improvements

### Performance Optimization

1. **Choose Appropriate Models**: Select models based on task complexity
2. **Optimize Routing**: Use efficient routing logic
3. **Minimize Redundancy**: Avoid unnecessary agent calls
4. **Monitor Resources**: Track memory and compute usage

### Team Collaboration

1. **Use Version Control**: Track changes to workflows
2. **Share Templates**: Create reusable workflow templates
3. **Document Decisions**: Explain why certain design choices were made
4. **Regular Reviews**: Review and update workflows regularly

## Integration

### Flo AI Integration

Export workflows directly to your Flo AI application:

```python
# Load studio-exported workflow
from flo_ai.arium import AriumBuilder

workflow = AriumBuilder.from_yaml('studio_workflow.yaml')
result = await workflow.build_and_run(["Input data"])
```

### API Integration

Connect to external APIs and services:

- **REST APIs**: Connect to web services
- **Database Connections**: Query databases for data
- **File Processing**: Handle file uploads and processing
- **Webhook Integration**: Receive and process webhooks

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Studio not loading">
    
    Try clearing the cache and reinstalling dependencies:
    
    ```bash
