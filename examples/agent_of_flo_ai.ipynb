    "\n",
    "Here are the major types of agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Agentic Agents (`kind: agentic`): Any agent created in flo-ai by default tries to be an agentic agent. This agent always needs a tool, meaning an agent without a tool if specified as agentic agent whill throw an exception\n",
    "\n",
    "2. LLM Agents (`kind: llm`): These agents are simply an LLM which can answer any questions asked to it. The agents dont except tools. If tool is passed to an agent of type llm, they are ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Tool LLM (`kind: tool`): These agents are just tools or functions that can be executed on the current state. Within the tool will be given the current state as the input, meaning the history of what happened in the network right now"
